# Overview
Hello! I'm Kyle and I'm here with ccledepmap-explorer. This README will instruct you on how to create a network plot using Dependency scores from CERES. 
I have two scripts available - one is if you already have the correlation matrix, and the other is if you only have the CERES score sheet.

To use the first script, you need to give R a correlation matrix sheet and a list of genes. If you want the one from the most updated CERES Dependency Dataset, download the ~2.2 GB file from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA6IJ2Mm_AHgAXjzNE5JDUFz8Kw6KT_S/view?usp=drive_link. Then, that can be your input when you run the code.

To use the second script, you can give R a dependency list of your choice. You might want to do this if you are only looking in a subset of cell lines for example. If you do that you'll probably have to manipulate the input sheet somehow but I can help with that.
